But the use of cutting fluid generally causes economy of tools and it becomes easier to keep tight tolerances and to maintain workpiece surface properties without damages. Because of them some alternatives has been sought to minimize or even avoid the use of cutting fluid in machining operations. Some of these alternatives are dry machining and machining with minimum quantity of lubrication (MQL). This paper deals with experimental investigations in the role of MQL on cutting temperature, chip formation and product quality in turning AISI-1040 steel at different industrial speed-feed combinations by uncoated carbide insert.

This study was conducted to find out the pollution situation of Turag river and the health problem of the surrounding residents. The results clearly determine that the water quality of Turag river may not be in a position to sustain the aquatic life and not suitable for using domestic purpose. This is indicated by the very low dissoloved oxygen (DO) levels and other measured parameters in the river. The maximum recorded values of pH, color, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride (Cl-), carbon-di-oxide (CO2) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were 7.1 mg/L, 625 ptcu, 97.2, 4.65 mg/L, 1816 mg/L, 676mg/L, 5 mg/L, 15.5, and 78 mg/L, respectively. The maximum concentration of turbidity, BOD, hardness, TDS, and COD found in the Turag river is much higher than the standard permissible limit.

Ninety-five percent of both adults and children were below their respective medians in weight as related to height; <15% of each group showed second-degree protein-calorie malnutrition. Duration of diarrhea, but not volume of stool per hour, was prolonged by 30%–70% in those adults and children suffering from more severe malnutrition. The increased stool loss was unrelated to antibiotic usage, to presence of intestinal parasites, or to the refeeding diet given. It is suggested that the prolongation of diarrhea represents the continued effect of cholera toxin that is irreversibly bound to intestinal mucosal cells, the replacement of which would be retarded under conditions of poor nutrition.","The severity of diarrhea and nutritional status were measured in a prospective study of 97 patients hospitalized with cholera in Dacca, Bangladesh.

Mung bean seeds were inoculated with peat-based inoculum and NP fertilizers were applied at 30-60 kg/ha, respectively. Results revealed that imposition of salinity reduced the growth and yield of mung bean. On the contrary, the separate application of L-TRP and Rhizobium appeared to mitigate the adverse effects of salt stress. However, their combined application produced more pronounced effects and increased the plant height (28.2%), number of nodules per plant (71.4%), plant biomass (61.2%), grain yield (65.3%), and grain nitrogen concentration (22.4%) compared with untreated control. The growth promotion effect might be due to higher auxin production in the rhizosphere and improved mineral uptake that reduced the adverse effects of salinity.

Punjab-96, Inqelab-91 and Pasban-90 were grown after applying Nitrophos (23: 23)@ 0 or 44 kg P ha-1 by two methods,(i) broadcast and incorporation at sowing and (ii) fertigation at first irrigation. Grain yield and total P uptake data obtained after crop harvest showed that wheat varieties differed significantly in grain and straw yield, harvest index and 1000-grain weight. Application of P by either method increased grain and straw yield as well as total P uptake over control. Method x P interaction effect was also significant for yield, indicating higher yield response due to fertigation compared to broadcast method of P application. Where P was applied by fertigation grain yield, total P uptake, agronomic and P fertilizer efficiency were all higher in cv. Inqelab-91 compared to cv. Pasban-90.

Laboratory analysis indicated that the pH, moisture and volatile solid contents were ranged from 7.70 to 8.69, 56 to 70% and 43 to 71%, respectively. The bulk densities were also ascertained in the three compactness states: loose, medium and compact. The mean nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents in organic component of MSW were obtained as 0.82, 0.30 and 0.66%, respectively. The highest calorific value was found 20,467 kJ/kg for rubber whereas the lowest was 5907 kJ/kg for food waste. The high content of organic matter and some essential macronutrients in the waste proves its high potentiality in the production of organic and organo-mineral fertilizers.

For this, ECG signals were collected carefully from BIOPAC data acquisition system and MIT-BIH database. MIT-BIH noise stress test database was used for generating realistic noises. In addition, to get a better denoised ECG, Symlet wavelet was chosen because its scaling function is closely related to the shape of ECG. For denoising ECG signal, a novel modified S-median thresholding technique is proposed and evaluated in this paper. The optimal Symlet wavelet of order 6 and decomposition level of 8 are attained for modified S-median thresholding technique.

Although movement-related activation correlates with the central lobe, this area of a paralyzed patient is often found obsolete.

The objective of this study is to evaluate three geostatistical (ordinary kriging [OK], ordinary cokriging [OCK], kriging with an external drift [KED]), and two deterministic (inverse distance weighting, radial basis function) interpolation methods for enhanced spatial interpolation of monthly rainfall in the Middle Yarra River catchment and the Ovens River catchment in Victoria, Australia. Historical rainfall records from existing rain‐gauge stations of the catchments during 1980–2012 period are used for the analysis. A …",Cited by 56

Accurate spatial distribution of rainfall can be achieved through a dense network of rain gauges. However, the rain gauge network is usually sparse in most cases and thus sufficient point rainfall measurements are not available, which are often unable to characterize the spatial distribution of highly variable rainfall. Spatial interpolation method plays an important role in such cases to estimate rainfall at unrecorded locations (ie, missing data) using the observed rainfall available at surrounding locations.",Cited by 3

In Bangladesh tubewell water extracted from shallow aquifers is the primary source of drinking/cooking water for most of its population, particularly the rural population. An estimated 7.5 to 8.0 million hand-tubewells constitute the backbone of the rural water supply in Bangladesh. Besides domestic use, huge quantities of water from shallow aquifer are also used for irrigation during the dry season. Although considerable work has been done on removal technologies of arsenic from contaminated groundwater and alternate water supply options, the presence of arsenic in irrigation water received relatively lesser attention. The dependency on groundwater for public water supplies and irrigation results in a huge quantity of arsenic being cycled through the environment each year with major implications on public health and environment. This paper presents an assessment of the use of groundwater for irrigation in Bangladesh and provides an assessment of the amount of arsenic that is extracted with groundwater used for irrigation as well as domestic purpose.

These were:(i) removal system based on alum and iron coagulation;(ii) removal system based on sorptive filtration using iron coated sand filter, and (iii) removal system based on sorptive filtration using gravel bed containing iron sludge. Based on laboratory performance, two technologies, ferric chloride coagulation, and sorptive filtration through iron-coated sand, were selected for the development of household arsenic removal units. The ferric chloride based unit is similar in design to the bucket treatment unit developed by DPHE-Danida. It involves precipitation of arsenic by adding a packet of coagulants to 25 liters of tubewell water and subsequent filtration of the water through a sand filter. The unit based on iron-coated sand has a pre-treatment system for removal of excess iron. This consists of a bucket where water is poured and stirred for sometime to accelerate precipitation of iron. The water then flows through a sand filter where the excess iron is filtered out. Finally the water is passed through the iron-coated sand filter. Field testing of 15 ferric chloride based units at Adda village in Barura thana of Comilla district showed very good arsenic removal efficiency. Arsenic concentrations in the treated water were found to be mostly below 20 ppb; while maximum arsenic concentration in the tubewell water was about 400 ppb.

For further tuning of the band gap, tensile biaxial strain is applied, resulting in a change in the band gap from 15 to 28 meV. The band gap can also be tuned by changing the interlayer distance …",Cited by 9

The resultant'device shrinking'reduces the soft error tolerance of the VLSI circuits, as very little energy is needed to change their states. Safety critical systems are very sensitive to soft errors. A bit flip due to soft error can change the value of critical variable and consequently the system control flow can completely be changed which leads to system failure. To minimize soft error risks, a novel methodology is proposed to detect and recover from soft errors considering only'critical code blocks' and'critical variables' rather than considering all variables and/or blocks in the whole program.

Leachate pollution index (LPI) is an environmental index used to quantify and compare the leachate contamination potential of solid waste landfill.

The aim is to study the sensitivity of wall shear stresses and the pressure distribution, at the impacting surface, in both non-swirling and low swirl intensities that do not induce vortex breakdown. A three-channel hotwire anemometer system is used to measure threedimensional time-mean velocity components and turbulent intensities at the nozzle exit plane. Pressure measurements are carried out via flush-mounted pressure taps on the impacting surface. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) approach with RNG k-ε model is used for numerical simulations, with the methodology validated against an experimental data set. The investigations are performed for non-swirling (S= 0) and low swirling (S= 0.09) cases in the near-field (H= 2D) at Re= 35,000. Results show the impingement pressure is sensitive to even low values of swirl whereby it reduces at the stagnation point, but the surface static pressure increases at the outer parts of the impacting region.

In this paper, firstly the temporal changes of pattern of different disasters in Bangladesh are discussed based on their occurrence rate, number of people killed, and exposure to human and economic loss. The paper is mainly concentrated on temporal variation of floods in Bangladesh. The decadal change in return period and probability of low, moderate and high flood events are presented. The term ‘Flood Intensity Index (FII)’is introduced to characterize the flood, which is considered as a function of inundation depth and duration. FII is calculated for two mega floods of 1988 and 1998. It is observed that although the average depth of inundation among two mega floods does not differ too much, the FII in 1998 was much higher (about double) than 1988 flood, and that is why the economic loss in 1998 flood was much higher (about 2.33 times) than that of 1988 flood. Previous data and various future predictions showed that both the parameters in FII are in increasing trend due to climate change impact. The climate change induced increament in river discharge during monsoon will increase the inundation depth, and the increasing trend of Sea Level Rise will increase the duration of flood due to back water effect of sea. Therefore, the Flood Intensity Index will significantly be increased due to climate change. Since, the ‘Flood Intensity Index (FII)’is a measurable index to characterize a flood accounting all the impacts of climate change, this index can be used in expressing the change in flooding scenario due to climate change.","Bangladesh is a disaster prone country, and the effect of climate change magnifies the governing factors of the disasters.

Beside the academic interests, present study contributes to understand the developement, extent and behaviour of flows in a dead zone for proper managemnet of river system and other water courses.","In this paper, the fundamental properties of flows in an open channel with a dead zone was studied through the three–dimensional numerical simulation using two types of dead zones: one was rectangular side cavity and another one was the dead zone created at the downstream of channel with width enchroachment (ie sudden enlarged zone). A non-linear k-ε model was employed using finite volume method with a curvilinear coordinate system. It was found that the flow in the side cavity is characterized by three types of flow phenomena: the circulation inside the dead-zone, periodic coherent vortices at the interface of main stream and dead zone, and the water surface oscillation inside the dead zone. In this study all these characteristics are successfully reproduced by numerical simulation. The time averaged flow properties and temporal change of velocity profiles are well compared with previous experimental results.

The main idea is to determine the best inter mode based on RSAD cost instead of the rate-distortion cost. This approach can avoid most of the computationally intensive processes in the H. 264/AVC mode decision, such as integer transform, quantization, variable length coding and pixelreconstruction. Besides, it can solve the problem of SAD-based cost function for H. 264/AVC mode decision in biasing to the smaller block size modes, as they are normally achieving higher prediction accuracy. It is demonstrated by experimental results that the proposed RSAD-based mode decision algorithm can reduce 60% to 68% of the H. 264/AVC total encoding time with negligible degradation in the rate-distortion performance. The proposed algorithm is also combined with SKIP mode early termination algorithm for further time saving and computation reduction. The enhanced algorithm with SKIP mode early termination technique could save up to 10% of the encoding time with only a little rate-distortion degradation.","In this paper, a new relative sum of absolute difference (RSAD) based inter mode decision algorithm is proposed for H. 264/AVC video standard.

Therefore, laboratory tests such as compaction, Atterberg limits, unconfined compressive strength, direct shear and consolidation tests for different percentages of cement content and original soil samples were performed. These test results show that the soil can be made lighter which leads to decrease in dry density and increase in moisture content and reduced compressibility due to the addition of cement with the soil.

These test results show that the soil can be made lighter which leads to decrease in dry density and increase in moisture content and reduced compressibility due to the addition of cement with the soil. Besides that the unconfined compressive strength and shear strength of soil can be optimized with the addition of 7.5% of cement content.",Cited by 46

In this paper, the flow field in two types of dead zone have been studied: one is rectangular side cavity and another one is the dead zone created at the downstream of channel with width enchroachment (ie sudden enlarged zone). A non-linear k-ε model is employed using finite volume method with a curvilinear coordinate system. It is found that the flow in the side cavity is characterized by three types of flow phenomena: the circulation inside the dead-zone, periodic coherent vortices at the interface of main stream and dead zone, and the water surface oscillation inside the dead zone. In this study all these characteristics are successfully reproduced by numerical simulation. The time averaged flow properties and temporal change of velocity profiles are well compared with previous experimental results. With increasing the length of the cavity, the circulation pattern and their numbers are changed along with velocity magnitude. For the open channel with sudden enlargment, although the upstream arrangemnet of flow domain is same as the cavity flow, the flow in the enlarged zone has the freedom to flow towards downstream in logitudinal direction. Due to this free downstream, the simulated flow field in the sudden enlarged zone is significantly different than that of open channel flows with side cavity.

In this paper, firstly the temporal changes of pattern of different disasters in Bangladesh are discussed based on their occurrence rate, number of people killed, and exposure to human and economic loss. The paper is mainly concentrated on temporal variation of floods in Bangladesh. The decadal change in return period and probability of low, moderate and high flood events are presented. The term ‘Flood Intensity Index (FII)’is introduced to characterize the flood, which is considered as a function of inundation depth and duration. FII is calculated for two mega floods of 1988 and 1998. It is observed that although the average depth of inundation among two mega floods does not differ too much, the FII in 1998 was much higher (about double) than 1988 flood, and that is why the economic loss in 1998 flood was much higher (about 2.33 times) than that of 1988 flood. Previous data and various future predictions showed that both the parameters in FII are in increasing trend due to climate change impact. The climate change induced increament in river discharge during monsoon will increase the inundation depth, and the increasing trend of Sea Level Rise will increase the duration of flood due to back water effect of sea. Therefore, the Flood Intensity Index will significantly be increased due to climate change. Since, the ‘Flood Intensity Index (FII)’is a measurable index to characterize a flood accounting all the impacts of climate change, this index can be used in expressing the change in flooding scenario due to climate change.","Bangladesh is a disaster prone country, and the effect of climate change magnifies the governing factors of the disasters.

Uddin",2016,"Trip generation and trip characteristics are essential in transportation planning process. A very small change in trip generation or trip characteristics can induce the necessity of new transportation infrastructure or the redevelopment of the existing infrastructure. Understanding and analyzing the trip characteristics and generation are pivotal concern in transportation planning process. Failure to do so can cause obsolescence the functionality of newly developed infrastructure and produce traffic congestion and road accident, engendering loss of valuable life, time and money. Considering this situation this study was conducted to determine the total number of trips generated in ward 19, 20 and 21 within Khulna City Corporation (KCC) area using crossclassification method. Moreover, this study also analyzed the trip characteristics based on socio economic factors of households. The study was carried out based on primary data that were collected from household based questionnaire survey. It is found that in the study area 7, 8369 trips were generated and Home Based Work (HBW) trips had the highest contribution in the total trip production. The study also found that with the increase of auto ownership the number of trip production reduced, however long distance trip increased. It is also observed that many people use rickshaw as their mode of transport despite of having higher number of auto ownership for short distance travel. The maximum numbers of trips are generated by the middle income people earning BDT 15000 to BDT 35000 per month. On the other hand, the high income people with earning more than BDT 35000 per month produced …","Trip generation and trip characteristics are essential in transportation planning process.
